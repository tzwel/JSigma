A barebones javascript code formatter and linter

## What and why?

JSigma is my private response to the progressing enshittification of the only JavaScript linter - Eslint. 

It's a barebones, overly simplistic linter and formatter that complies with my personal [style guide](./rules.md), so it's heavily opinionated. Also, it doesn't rely on an AST just yet, and uses many naive parsing techniques that *just work*. This means that JSigma WILL report false positives, but I'm trying to limit it acting on them. 

As a obvious fun-fact: JSigma is linted by itself.

## How to use?

You better not. I'm serious. Use anything else.
